            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>With over 7 years of progressive experience as a Technical Writer, Operation Associate, Team Leader, Technical Content Writer, and Copy Editor, I bring in-depth expertise in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Document Development Life Cycle (DDLC). I am proficient in Information Mapping and established techniques for presenting documentation, and have supervised workflows in Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) within a Scaled Agile Framework. My skills include core technical communication concepts such as topic-based authoring, minimalism, task-oriented design, DITA, and Single Sourcing. I have extensive experience in designing and creating various forms of technical content, including User Guides, API Guides, Online Help, Product Documentation (Release Notes, Learning Material, etc.) for software products. I am highly knowledgeable in Technical Writing Principles and familiar with style guides like Microsoft Style Guide (MSTP) and company-specific ones. I efficiently maintain the CMS for the entire department, ensuring proper checks and revisions, while delivering documents that are both clear and tailored to the intended audience. I am adept at engaging with SMEs, facilitating the review process, and consistently managing multiple projects under tight deadlines. With the ability to write content meeting both international and domestic client requirements, I also excel in proofreading and reviewing documents for format, consistency, grammar, syntax, spelling, accuracy, and adherence to standard guidelines.</p> </div>
